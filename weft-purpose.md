The goal of the Weft project is to create a new development framework that allows developers to:

1. **Achieve Native Performance**: Weft aims to provide a way to build applications that can achieve completely native performance across multiple target platforms (iOS, Android, web, desktop) without sacrificing performance.

2. **Share Code Across Platforms**: The goal is to enable developers to share a significant portion of their codebase, including business logic and data models, across different platforms, rather than having to maintain separate codebases for each target platform.

3. **Leverage Language Models**: Weft proposes using language models to translate the high-level, structured "pseudocode" written in the Weft language into idiomatic, platform-specific code (e.g., Swift, Kotlin) while maintaining full control and understanding of the codebase.

4. **Combine Human and AI Strengths**: The aim is to create a development workflow that combines the strengths of human developers (understanding the problem domain, high-level design) with the strengths of language models (syntax translation, code generation) to improve efficiency and productivity, while still allowing developers to maintain control and understanding of the codebase.

Weft seeks to provide a new development paradigm that enables truly native, cross-platform applications with shared code, while preserving the developer's control and understanding of the codebase through the use of a custom, structured "pseudocode" language and language model integration.
